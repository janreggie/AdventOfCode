= Advent of Code

Nothing much to say, really.

== Syntax

----
./AdventOfCode [profiling flags] -year 2015 -day 4 -input file
----
will solve the Day 4 problem of Year 2015
using `file` as the input file.
This will print out the answer as output.

=== Profiling flags
Profiling flags are as follows.

Only one of them may be active at a time:

* `-cpuprof`: writes CPU profile to `cpu.pprof`
* `-memprof`: writes memory profile to `mem.pprof`
* `-trace`: writes execution trace to `trace.out`

== Program flow and structure
`main.go` reads the input `file` to a buffer `bufio.Scanner`.
They are passed on to the "`solver functions`"
of type signature `func(*bufio.Scanner) (string, string, error)`,
which print out the answers for Parts 1 and 2
and an applicable error.
